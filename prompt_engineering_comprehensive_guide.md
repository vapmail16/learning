- **Structure**: Organization, flow, hierarchy

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### **1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

#### **Concept**:
Encourage the model to show its reasoning process step-by-step before providing the final answer.

#### **Basic Example**:
```
Question: Sarah has 12 apples. She gives 3 to her friend and buys 8 more. How many apples does she have now?

Let me think through this step by step:
1. Sarah starts with 12 apples
2. She gives away 3 apples: 12 - 3 = 9 apples
3. She buys 8 more apples: 9 + 8 = 17 apples
4. Therefore, Sarah has 17 apples now.
```

#### **Advanced Chain-of-Thought**:
```
Question: A company's revenue increased by 20% in Q1, then decreased by 15% in Q2. If the original revenue was $100,000, what's the current revenue?

Let me solve this systematically:

Step 1: Calculate Q1 revenue after 20% increase
Original revenue: $100,000
Increase: 20% of $100,000 = $20,000
Q1 revenue: $100,000 + $20,000 = $120,000

Step 2: Calculate Q2 revenue after 15% decrease
Q1 revenue: $120,000
Decrease: 15% of $120,000 = $18,000
Q2 revenue: $120,000 - $18,000 = $102,000

Step 3: Verify the calculation
Net change: +20% then -15%
Effective change: (1 + 0.20) × (1 - 0.15) = 1.20 × 0.85 = 1.02
Final revenue: $100,000 × 1.02 = $102,000

Answer: The current revenue is $102,000.
```

#### **Benefits**:
- **Transparency**: Shows how the model arrived at its answer
- **Error Detection**: Easier to spot and correct mistakes
- **Learning**: Helps users understand the reasoning process
- **Accuracy**: Often leads to more accurate results

### **2. Self-Consistency Prompting**

#### **Concept**:
Generate multiple responses to the same question and select the most consistent answer.

#### **Implementation**:
```
Question: What are the main causes of climate change?

Generate 3 different responses to this question, then identify the most comprehensive and accurate answer.

Response 1: [Generate first response]
Response 2: [Generate second response]  
Response 3: [Generate third response]

Now analyze these responses and provide the most consistent and accurate answer.
```

#### **Benefits**:
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces random errors
- **Confidence**: Higher confidence in the selected answer
- **Quality**: Often produces higher quality responses
- **Reliability**: More consistent results across similar questions

### **3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting**

#### **Concept**:
Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously and evaluate them to find the best solution.

#### **Example**:
```
Problem: Design a sustainable transportation system for a city of 1 million people.

Let me explore different approaches:

Approach 1: Public Transportation Focus
- Pros: High capacity, energy efficient, reduces traffic
- Cons: High initial cost, requires infrastructure

### **4. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Prompting**

#### **Concept**:
Combine reasoning with action-taking in a structured format.

#### **Format**:
```
Thought: [Reasoning about the current situation]
Action: [Specific action to take]
Observation: [Result of the action]
Thought: [Analysis of the observation]
Action: [Next action based on analysis]
...
```

#### **Example**:
```
Task: Help a user troubleshoot their computer that won't start.

Thought: The user's computer won't start. I need to gather more information about the symptoms to diagnose the issue.
Action: Ask the user to describe what happens when they try to turn on the computer.
Observation: User says "Nothing happens when I press the power button - no lights, no sounds, no fan noise."
Thought: This suggests a power supply issue or complete hardware failure. I should ask about recent changes and check basic connections.
Action: Ask "Did you make any recent changes to the computer? Also, please check if the power cable is securely connected and if the power outlet is working."
Observation: User says "I installed new RAM yesterday, and the power cable is connected. The outlet works with other devices."
Thought: The RAM installation is likely the cause. Improperly installed RAM can prevent the computer from starting.
Action: Instruct the user to remove and reinstall the RAM modules, ensuring they're properly seated.

- **Compression**: Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- **Efficiency**: Use more direct language and structure
- **Template Reuse**: Create reusable templates for similar tasks
- **Context Management**: Only include relevant context

**System Optimization**:
- **Caching**: Cache frequent prompts and responses
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple requests together
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate model size for the task
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing across multiple instances

**Example Optimization**:
```
# Before optimization
prompt = f"""
You are an expert data analyst with 10+ years of experience in business intelligence and data visualization. 
Your task is to analyze the provided dataset and create a comprehensive report that includes statistical analysis, 
trend identification, and actionable insights. The report should be professional, data-driven, and suitable for 
executive presentation. Please ensure all calculations are accurate and include relevant charts and graphs.
Dataset: {data}
"""

# After optimization
prompt = f"""
You are a data analyst. Analyze this dataset and create an executive report with:
- Key statistics and trends
- 3 actionable insights
- Professional tone
Dataset: {data}
"""
```

#### **5. How do you measure the effectiveness of prompts?**

**Answer**: Use multiple metrics and evaluation methods:

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct responses
- **Consistency**: Variance in response quality
- **Latency**: Response time
- **Cost**: Token usage and associated costs
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per unit time

**Qualitative Metrics**:
- **Relevance**: How well responses address the input
- **Completeness**: Whether all aspects are covered
- **Clarity**: How clear and understandable responses are
- **User Satisfaction**: User ratings and feedback

**Evaluation Methods**:
- **Automated Testing**: Use test cases and expected outputs
- **Human Evaluation**: Expert review of response quality
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt versions
- **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user ratings
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics over time

**Example Evaluation Framework**:
```
def evaluate_prompt_effectiveness(prompt, test_cases):
    results = {
        'accuracy': 0,
        'consistency': 0,
        'latency': 0,
        'user_satisfaction': 0
    }
    
    for test_case in test_cases:
        # Test accuracy
        response = generate_response(prompt, test_case['input'])
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(response, test_case['expected'])
        results['accuracy'] += accuracy
        
        # Test consistency
        responses = [generate_response(prompt, test_case['input']) for _ in range(5)]
        consistency = calculate_consistency(responses)
        results['consistency'] += consistency
        
        # Test latency
        start_time = time.time()
        generate_response(prompt, test_case['input'])
        latency = time.time() - start_time
        results['latency'] += latency
    
    # Calculate averages
    for metric in results:
        results[metric] /= len(test_cases)
    
    return results
```
